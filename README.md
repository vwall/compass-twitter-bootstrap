    bundle install

**Import it into your SCSS file**

    @import "compass_twitter_bootstrap";

## Usage with asset pipeline(Rails 3.2)

    gem 'compass-rails'

    config.load_paths << Compass::Frameworks['twitter_bootstrap'].stylesheets_directory

    ...

## Using [Font Awesome](http://fortawesome.github.com/Font-Awesome/)

To use the font awesome font and icons simply change the standard import to:

    @import "compass_twitter_bootstrap_awesome"

## Using Javascripts with Rails Asset Pipeline

Javascript Libraries are located in vendor/assets/javascripts

Include them individually or

    //=require bootstrap-all

to include all files

## SCSS to SASS Conversion tip

To easily convert `.scss` files to `.sass` files you can use this little bash script:

`$ for f in *.scss; do sass-convert -F scss -T sass $f ${f%%.*}.sass; done`

To convert all twitter bootstrap .scss files to .sass (with overwrite):

`$ for f in stylesheets/compass_twitter_bootstrap/*.scss; do sass-convert -F scss -T sass $f stylesheets_sass/compass_twitter_bootstrap/${f%%.*}.sass; done`

`$ for f in stylesheets/*.scss; do sass-convert -F scss -T sass $f stylesheets_sass/${f%%.*}.sass; done`

Nice and easy :)

## Upgrading

If you want to contribute and help out keeping this gem in sync with the latest release of Twitter Bootstrap, you should keep in mind that all mixins are prefixed with `ctb-`.
With this prefixed we can't run into problems where the converted less-mixins conflict with native Compass names, parameters, ...

There is a Rake-task that will help you to fetch all recent changes from the Twitter Bootstrap master:

`rake convert`

When that is done

* update the assets
* replace `$media` with `@media` , `$page` with `@page` , `$-ms-keyframes` with `@-ms-keyframes` , `$-o-keyframes` with `@-o-keyframes` , `$-ms-viewport` with `@-ms-viewport`, see https://github.com/vwall/compass-twitter-bootstrap/issues/100.
* replace `ctb-reset-filter` with `ctb-gradient-reset-filter`
* replace `ctb-span(` with `ctb-core-span(`
* replace `@include ctb-opacity(100)` with `@include ctb-opacity(1)` as seen in https://github.com/vwall/compass-twitter-bootstrap/commit/b80ea1bc20f031a4abad7906ba14590bccadc74e
* search for `(e(` and fix it
* search for `&-` and fix it, see https://github.com/vwall/compass-twitter-bootstrap/issues/101
* search for `.navbar-fixed-bottom .container {` and fix it
* readd the imports into _buttons.scss as seen in https://github.com/vwall/compass-twitter-bootstrap/commit/18d2d061235d5477c3a30beab9f02c7e9387f0c4
* add utility classes defined in mixins.scss to stylesheets/_compass_twitter_bootstrap*.scss (right after importing mixins)

@remark: if some Ruby-genius wants to automate this feel free
